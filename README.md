# Project Name
Predicting Demand for Shared Bikes using Multiple Linear Regression
> Outline a brief description of your project.

BoomBikes, a US bike-sharing provider, has seen a decline in revenue due to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. To prepare for when the situation improves and demand for shared bikes increases, they have contracted a consulting company to analyze factors that affect demand for shared bikes in the American market. BoomBikes wants to know which variables are significant in predicting bike demand and how well those variables describe demand. The consulting company will use a dataset of daily bike demand based on various meteorological surveys and people's styles to model the demand for shared bikes with independent variables. This model will help BoomBikes adjust their business strategy to meet demand levels and customer expectations while also understanding the demand dynamics of a new market.

## Table of Contents
* [General Info](#general-information)
The goal of this project is to build a multiple linear regression model to predict the demand for shared bikes based on various factors like season, weather, and day of the week. We will be using the BoomBikes dataset, which contains daily counts of bike rentals along with various features such as weather, temperature, and day of the week. The aim of this project is to help BoomBikes understand the factors that affect bike rentals and to use this information to optimize their business strategy.

* [Technologies Used](#technologies-used)
Python 3
Jupyter Notebook
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
Scikit-learn

* [Conclusions](#conclusions)
Based on our analysis, we will provide insights and recommendations to BoomBikes on how to optimize their business strategy to meet the demand for shared bikes.
